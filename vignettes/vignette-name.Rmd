# Introduction

DoAggregate is a tool designed to perform association testing on a cohort of patients and controls using aggregation tests. 

DoAggregate is a comprehensive pipeline for aggregation testing that facilitates in-depth exploration of genetic regions across genomes and exomes. By combining detailed annotations, robust statistical frameworks and user-friendly outputs, DoAggregate improves the interpretation of genomic data.

it has been based on 

This vignette will guide you through the process of using DoAggregate, from submitting your cohort for analysis to interpreting the results.

---

## Installation

To use DoAggregate, you can use the R package, or choose to install the slurm version (highly parallelized)

---

## Getting Started

### Submitting a Cohort for Analysis

To submit a cohort for association testing, follow these steps:


---

## Citing This Work

Any publication that discloses findings arising from DoAggregate must cite the original publication (currently under revision). 


---

## Technical Seminar

For a deeper understanding of DoAggregate, you can watch the [1-hour recording](data/Genetic_seminar_07_02_23.mp4) of the genetic seminar given by Simon Boutry. The seminar covers the theory behind DoAggregate, how to use the website, and a live demonstration of results exploration. You can also download the [PowerPoint slides](data/2022_12_20_genetic_seminar_Excalibur_Web.pptx) from the seminar.

## How to Use DoAggregate

### Starting Your Submission

1. **Choose How to Import Your Data**:
   - **Import Data via gVCF**: Use this option if your .
   - **Import Data via TSV files**: Upload your patient and control files directly. Ensure the files meet the required criteria.

2. **Optional: Restrict Analysis to a Gene List**:
   - If you want to analyze a specific set of genes, upload a gene list in TXT or TSV format.

3. **Clean Your Data**:
   - Use the coverage of each position to clean your data. This step is recommended to improve the reliability of results but can be time-consuming.

4. **Advanced Parameters**:
   - For advanced users, you can modify parameters for data cleaning and aggregation tests. However, it is recommended to use the default settings.

### Importing Your Data

1. **Prepare Your TSV Files**:
   - You must provide two TSV files: one for patients and one for controls. Both files must include the following mandatory columns:
     - `sample`: Unique identifier for an individual.
     - `pathology`: Unique identifier for individuals with the same pathology.
     - `chr`: Chromosome.
     - `pos`: Position.
     - `reference`: Reference base.
     - `alternative`: Alternative base.
     - `zygosity`: Zygosity of the variant (Heterozygous or Homozygous).
     - `gene_symbol`: Gene annotation from the HUGO database.
     - `gnomad_wes_af`: Alternative allele frequency in the GnomAD Whole Exome Samples.

2. **Upload Your Files**:
   - Ensure the files are formatted correctly and meet the required criteria.

3. **Optional: Upload a Gene List**:
   - Provide a gene list in TXT or TSV format with one gene per line.

### Results Description


In this section, we describe the results folders and files that **DoAggregate** will return as output. Folder names will be in **bold** (e.g., **NameOfFolder**) and optional files will be in *italic* (e.g., *exampleOfFile*). If no genes with significant aggregation are found, then the file *significant general info* will not exist in the **Gene** folder.

## General

This folder contains results from the cleaning process, over-representation analysis, and global information about the three levels of analysis (i.e., gene, overrepresented pathway, and overrepresented GO terms).

File IDs 1 to 6 correspond to the cleaning process using the coverage matrix. 

- File IDs 3 to 5 are histograms showing the number of positions badly covered per individual before and after filtering.
- File ID 1 is a histogram showing the number of badly covered individuals per position.
- File ID 6 is a summary table containing information on patients, controls, and variants before and after cleaning.

The over-representation analysis starts by converting gene identifiers using `bitr` from **clusterProfiler**. If an input gene cannot be mapped to an ENTREZID, it is stored in File ID 28. 

## GO Term Analysis

Files ID 7 to 13 are generated for GO term over-representation analysis using **clusterProfiler**:

- File ID 7: GO terms with adjusted p-values ≤ 0.05 are retained.
- File ID 8: Collapsed terms from the analysis.
- File ID 9: GO terms filtered based on similarity.
- File IDs 11-13: Plots of the top 20 most significant GO terms.

The **CC** and **MF** folders follow the same structure. Files ID 9 and 12 are specific to GO term analysis, while others are common to all databases analyzed.

## Pathway Analysis

- File ID 16-19 and 22: Over-representation results for pathway databases.
- File IDs 20 and 21: Top 20 most significant pathways plotted.
- File IDs 23-27: Pathway analysis across all databases.

The results are merged and least significant pathways/GO terms mapping to the same gene list are removed (File ID 29). The top 20 terms are plotted (File ID 31). A co-occurrence matrix is built using the top 100 significant results (File ID 32, plotted in File ID 33).

## Gene-Level Analysis

Files ID 36-39 store results for individual genetic regions:

- File ID 36: Genetic regions discarded due to filtering criteria.
- File ID 37: Analyzed genetic regions.
- File ID 38: Regions with Excalibur q-value ≤ 0.05.
- File ID 39: Significant regions with more variants in patients than controls.

Each genetic region is annotated with:

- Number of patients/controls with at least one variant.
- Total and unique variant counts.
- Best q-value from Excalibur.
- Aggregation tests that returned significant p-values.

Significant genes undergo additional over-representation analysis (Folders ID 40 and 41). For significant regions in File ID 39, raw input variant data is stored in **Folder ID 42**, with one Excel file per genetic region.

## Overrepresented Pathways and GO Terms

These two folders contain the results of pathway and GO term aggregation tests, structured similarly to the **Gene** results (Files ID 36-39, **Folder ID 42**).
